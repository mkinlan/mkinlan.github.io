							Hello! My name is Morgana Kinlan, and I became a data scientist because I like to solve puzzles and create things. 
							I’m particularly partial to visualizations in R, and I’m currently working on expanding into Tableau (let’s face it, the maps are awesome).<br>
							</p>
							<p>
							I earned my Master’s in Analytics in 2019, and I’ve been working with financial data for several years. 
							I believe that every business can benefit from data science, from mom and pop stores to global enterprises. 
							Data is everywhere in today’s world, and exploring and examining that data is crucial to understanding the problems that we face and 
							developing their solutions.
